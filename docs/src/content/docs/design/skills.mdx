## Overview

**Skills** are domain-specific knowledge modules that extend agent capabilities. Unlike tools (which provide actions), skills provide *knowledge* and *context* that guide how agents approach problems.

```
Skills = Knowledge (how to approach)
Tools  = Capabilities (how to execute)
```

## Skill Structure

Each skill is a directory containing:

```
skills/
└── antigravity/
    ├── SKILL.md      # Frontmatter + instructions
    └── index.ts      # Tool definitions (optional)
```

### SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: antigravity
description: Monitors and heals Antigravity IDE agent errors
---

# Antigravity Healer

You are a health monitor for the Antigravity IDE...

## Detection Rules
- Look for "Agent Terminated" errors
- Check cascade panel visibility

## Recovery Procedure
1. Call antigravity_check_and_heal
2. Report status
```

The frontmatter defines metadata, and the markdown body provides instructions injected into the agent's system prompt.

## Skill Tools

Skills can provide specialized tools via `index.ts`:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

export function getTools() {
  return {
    antigravity_check_and_heal: {
      description: "Scan for errors and auto-recover",
      inputSchema: z.object({}),
      execute: async () => {
        // Domain-specific implementation
        return { status: "HEALTHY", message: "All good" };
      },
    },
  };
}
```

## Using Skills

Skills are assigned to agents via configuration:

```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "Healer",
  skills: ["antigravity"],  // Skill IDs
  tools: ["browser"],       // Separate from skills
});
```

Or in YAML job definitions:

```yaml
name: Antigravity Healer
skills:
  - antigravity
tools:
  - browser
prompt: |
  Call antigravity_check_and_heal to monitor health.
```

## Skills vs Tools

| Aspect | Skills | Tools |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Purpose | Teach domain knowledge | Provide actions |
| Loaded as | System prompt instructions | Callable functions |
| Example | "How to heal Antigravity" | `browser.click()` |

<Aside type="tip">
Skills encapsulate both *knowledge* (instructions) and *specialized tools* for a specific domain. This follows the "Atomic Skill-Level Healing" principle where detection and recovery are bundled together.
</Aside>

## Built-in Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `antigravity` | Monitor and heal IDE agent errors |
| `calculator` | Basic arithmetic (example skill) |

## Creating Custom Skills

1. Create a directory under `src/skills/`:
   ```
   src/skills/my-skill/
   ├── SKILL.md
   └── index.ts
   ```

2. Define the SKILL.md with frontmatter and instructions

3. Optionally export tools from `index.ts`

4. Reference by skill ID in agent config
