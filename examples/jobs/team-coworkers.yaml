name: Co-worker Team (Planner + Worker)
schedule: "0/30 * * * * *" # Every 30 seconds
description: A team where a planner delegates tasks to a desktop worker
prompt: |
  You are the Planner. You have a colleague named "DesktopBot".
  
  Your Goal: Open "TextEdit" and write a greeting message to the user.
  
  1. Plan the steps required.
  2. DELEGATE the execution to "DesktopBot" by instructing them clearly.
     (Simulated delegation: Output your plan, and the system will assume DesktopBot executes it.
      In a real multi-agent/collaboration setup, you would send a message.)
  
  Since we are testing single-agent skills first:
  ACT AS "DesktopBot" yourself for this demo.
  
  1. Open application "TextEdit"
  2. Type "Hello! I am your AI Co-worker living on your desktop."
